# Currency converter

## Overview

This project is a Currency Exchange Rate Converter, developed in Java, aimed at providing users with real-time 
exchange rates for various currencies. It utilizes the HttpResponse and HttpRequest classes for API communication, 
List, ArrayList, and Map for data handling, and Scanner for user input.

## Features
- Real-time Exchange Rates: The application fetches the latest exchange rates from an API, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- Currency Conversion: Users can input the currency they have and the currency they want to convert to, and the software calculates and displays the converted amount.
- Support for Multiple Currencies: The system supports a wide range of currencies, enabling conversions for various international transactions.
